# Lab 4 Applied Programming
My simple project to get started with pyenv, virtualenv, flask and WSGI.

# Requirments
- [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
- [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#leaving-the-virtual-environment)

# Initialization
In order to run my project succesfully you will need to install all the packages from requirments.txt. To do this you will have to run one simple command in terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links file:///tmp/packages
```
After that you just open two terminals, and in the first one simply type in:
```
startup.cmd
```
This command will launch a server.<br>
To execute the program open the second terminal and type in:
```
execute.cmd
```
